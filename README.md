# General Info

This folder contains all front-end resources: the html, css, js, and flask that renders templates and interacts with the api.

The static folder will contain the files that always stay the same, i.e. styling and javascript for user interaction.

The templates folder contains html templates for each page on the site. These templates are dynamic depending on the information received from the api.

routes.py is the front-end flask app that gets information from the api and renders it into into the html templates.
